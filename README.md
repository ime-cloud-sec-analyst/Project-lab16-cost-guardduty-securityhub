# 🔐 Lab 16: AWS Cost Optimization + GuardDuty Tuning + Security Hub Integration

## 🎯 Objectives

- Identify unused resources and cost-saving opportunities using Trusted Advisor & Cost Explorer.
- Detect threats using Amazon GuardDuty and tune noisy findings.
- Aggregate security findings and assess posture using AWS Security Hub.

---

## 🛠️ Services Used

- AWS Trusted Advisor  
- AWS Cost Explorer  
- Amazon GuardDuty

## 📊 Key Findings

### ✅ Trusted Advisor
- Found open security groups (0.0.0.0/0)
- Suggested limiting access on ports

### ✅ Cost Explorer
- Total cost: **$22.42**
- High usage: **EC2-Other**, **KMS**, **Route53**
- Forecast shows predictable trend

### ✅ GuardDuty
- Enabled in Ireland region
- Findings:
  - `RootCredentialUsage`
  - 2 low-severity alerts (IAM Access Key)
- Created filter for `resourceType = IAMUser` + `Severity = High`

### ✅ Security Hub
- Standards enabled:
  - AWS Foundational Security Best Practices
  - CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark
- Posture findings generated (13):
  - Missing protection coverage for:
    - EKS
    - Lambda
    - RDS
    - S3
    - EC2 Malware
    - Runtime Monitoring

## 🧠 Skills Gained

- Cost analysis using AWS-native tools
- Threat detection and alert triage
- Posture assessment using Security Hub
- Real-world scenario building for cloud audit & compliance

---

## ⚠️ Challenges & Fixes

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Security Hub standards not initially visible | Manually enabled via UI and posture management |
| No GuardDuty high-severity alerts | Simulated low-severity alerts and filtered |

---

## ✅ Outcome

This lab provides a practical foundation in **cloud cost optimization and threat visibility**, simulating real-world SOC operations and cloud audit preparation.
